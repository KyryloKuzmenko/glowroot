              How does the game balance difficulty?
            </h4>
            <p class="faq-swiper-text">
              The game is designed to start easy and gradually increase in
              complexity to keep players challenged but not overwhelmed. Early
              levels help you familiarize yourself with the mechanics and
              glowing blocks. As you progress, puzzles introduce new block
              shapes, time limits, and strategic constraints that require
              careful thinking. The game also offers daily challenges and
              special events with varied difficulties for a change of pace. This
              balance ensures players of all experience levels remain engaged
              and motivated. The hint system further supports players if a
              puzzle becomes too difficult.

            </h4>
            <p class="faq-swiper-text">
              Absolutely! One of the great features of Glow Block Puzzle is that
              it works perfectly offline. You don’t need an internet connection
              to access your saved progress or play new levels. This makes it
              ideal for travel, commuting, or any moment when connectivity is
              limited or unavailable. Your game progress is saved locally on
              your device, so you can pick up anytime without worry. Of course,
              some online features like leaderboards and community interactions
              require internet access but are optional. Offline play ensures you
              can enjoy the game anytime, anywhere.

              How is my progress saved in Glow Block Puzzle?

              Your progress is saved automatically in real-time as you complete
              levels or make moves. This means you never have to worry about
              losing your place if you close the app or receive a phone call.
              The auto-save feature works silently in the background, storing
              your progress locally on your device. We are also working on cloud
              syncing for future updates so you can access your game on multiple
              devices seamlessly. In the meantime, rest assured that your
              current level, earned rewards, and hint counts are all securely
              preserved. This feature lets you focus on the puzzles, not on
              saving.

              How do hints work in Glow Block Puzzle?
            </h4>
            <p class="faq-swiper-text">
              Hints are designed to help you through challenging puzzles without
              spoiling the fun. You receive up to 10 hints per puzzle, each
              providing subtle guidance by highlighting potential moves or
              strategies. The hints encourage learning by nudging you toward the
              solution rather than giving it outright. If you run out of hints,
              you can earn more by completing levels or purchase additional
              hints as an optional boost. This system balances challenge and
              support, ensuring you never get stuck for too long. Using hints
              strategically can also help improve your puzzle-solving skills
              over time.
